function [K, Rc_w, Pc, pp, pv] = DecomposeCamera(P)
% DECOMPOSECAMERA  Decomposition of a camera projection matrix
%
% Usage:  [K, Rc_w, Pc, pp, pv] = decomposecamera(P);
%
%    P is decomposed into the form P = K*[R -R*Pc]
%
% Argument:  P - 3 x 4 camera projection matrix
% Returns:
%            K - Calibration matrix of the form
%                  |  ax   s   ppx |
%                  |   0   ay  ppy |
%                  |   0   0    1  |
%
%                Where:
%                ax = f/pixel_width and ay = f/pixel_height,
%                ppx and ppy define the principal point in pixels,
%                s is the camera skew.
%         Rc_w - 3 x 3 rotation matrix defining the world coordinate frame
%                in terms of the camera frame. Columns of R transposed define
%                the directions of the camera X, Y and Z axes in world
%                coordinates.
%           Pc - Camera centre position in world coordinates.
%           pp - Image principal point.
%           pv - Principal vector  from the camera centre C through pp
%                pointing out from the camera.  This may not be the same as
%                R'(:,3) if the principal point is not at the centre of the
%                image, but it should be similar.
